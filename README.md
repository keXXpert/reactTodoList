Simple ToDo-list Single Page Application (SPA) on React.js, using Hooks (including one custom), prop-types, preloader, sample ajax request, modal window, demo class component, css modules etc.

No other libraries are used in this app (no axios, Redux, etc.)


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
